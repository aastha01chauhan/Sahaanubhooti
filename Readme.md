# Hello :wave:

Welcome to **SAHAANUBHOOTI** , a blood donation project. The reason to donate is simpleâ€¦it helps save lives. In fact, every two seconds of every day, someone needs blood. But sometimes it gets hard to find blood and also some people find it threatening to donate blood.

## What is Sahaanubhooti?

**Sahaanubhooti** is an app that is here to make us realise the need in healthcare sector to sort to technology to meet people's insuppressible need of blood. Actually, people needing the most blood include those:

being treated for cancer,
undergoing orthopedic surgeries,
undergoing cardiovascular surgeries,
being treated for inherited blood disorders


## Our project goal

The main goal of our project is to make it easier for the patients to get a blood donor easily and as soon as possible as it gets much difficult to find a donor in some cases. In most of the case, it has seen that patients look for donors in facebook group or just by posting randomly which in some case is not helpful. Here our project will help the patient to find a donor fast when they need.

## Work flow of the project

The person who wants to donate his/her plasma need to register and create his/her profile first in our application providing required information which are name, blood group, phone number and location. He/She can also share his/her winning story to motivate others.

Patients who need blood don't need to create account. They can look for a donor from the home page. Patients can directly call the donor from the application by clicking on the dial button. Patients can also read the corresponding donor's story.
